     <p> Ever since the winter of 2018, I have been fascinated by the world of competitive Rubik's Cube solving. 
       <br>
       As of June 2024, I have attended 16 competitions, completing 600 solves in 12 different events.
       <br>
       I specialize in the traditional 3x3x3 (PR: 6.72 seconds) and the Pyraminx event (PR: 2.12 seconds). 
       <br>
       <br>
       In January 2023, my average of 5 solves in the pyraminx event ranked #73 in the United States and #9 in California.
