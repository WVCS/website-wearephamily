     <p> Ever since the winter of 2018, I have been fascinated by the world of competitive Rubik's Cube solving. 
       <br>
       As of June 2024, I have attended 16 competitions, completing 500+ solves in 11 different events.
       <br>
       I specialize in the traditional 3x3x3 (PR: 6.72 seconds) and the Pyraminx event (PR: 2.12 seconds). 
       <br>
       <br>
       In January 2023, my average of 5 solves in the Pyraminx event ranked #73 in the United States and #9 in California. 
       <br>

     <p> I have been playing the Cello for 8 years and the piano for nearly 10.
       <br>
       In my free time, I love playing the music I love, such as Billy Joel's Piano Man or Elton John's Rocket Man.

     <p> I can never pass up a chance to root for the Dodgers!  
       <br>
       Ever since I was introduced to Baseball when I was 9, I have been an avid fan of the sport ever since!
       <br>
       Even through their postseason struggles, the Dodgers will always have a special place in my heart.
       <br>
       Go Blue!

     <p> I have been a hurdler on my school's Varsity Track & Field team for 3 years now!
       <br>
       I specialize in the 110m (PR: 17.75) and 300m hurdles (PR: 46.21). 
       <br>
       I am most proud of being a member of the 4x110m Shuttle Hurdle Relay team, where we have held the school record 3 times!
